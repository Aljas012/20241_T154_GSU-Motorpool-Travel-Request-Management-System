The 20241_T154_GSU-Motorpool Travel Request Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of requesting and managing travel arrangements within an organization. It features three user interfaces for different roles: clients, supervisor, and the admin. Clients can submit travel requests, which are sent for approval to the supervisor. Upon approval, the requests are forwarded to the admin for vehicle allocation. The system enhances efficiency, ensures proper authorization, and provides a centralized platform for managing travel logistics, ultimately improving the overall travel management experience within the organization.
